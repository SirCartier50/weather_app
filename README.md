## Getting Started
You can either use this link to the deployed site: https://weather-app-six-tau-18.vercel.app/

or

Run the development server with these commands assuming node.js was installed since this is as next.js app:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
